            <strong>Athariq Games Studio</strong> makes story-driven games built for immersion—\n
            the kind that linger after the screen goes dark.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our name, <strong>Athariq</strong>, comes from the Arabic word <strong>Ṭarīq</strong>—\n
            meaning <em>path</em> or <em>journey</em>. That idea guides everything we create:\n
            not just where a story ends, but how it feels to walk through it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We craft original worlds with a strong atmosphere, where choices matter because\n
            they reveal character, test conviction, and shape the road ahead. We don’t chase\n
            noise or spectacle—we build experiences with purpose, meant to be lived at your pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our slogan is simple: <strong>“The Journey Is the Game.”</strong>\n
            We hope each title becomes a path worth taking—one you remember, and one that leaves\n
            a trace.
